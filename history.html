      <h1>History</h1>

<p>There is nothing more frustrating than looking at a commit from 6 months ago  that just says &quot;Fix bug&quot; or &quot;Refactor&quot; when you were looking at the reason behind a change. A good and clean version history gives you the power to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find where and why bugs were introduced</li>
<li>Why certain changes happened</li>
<li>What has been released when</li>
<li>What feature has been built when</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example of a good history</h2>

<h1>Commits</h1>

<p>Two things are important when creating a commit:</p>

<ol>
<li>The changes it contains must be atomic</li>
<li>The message must be exact and concise</li>
</ol>

<h2>Atomicity</h2>

<p>All changes in a single commit should be related. The commit &quot;Explain when to tag versions&quot; should contain only that explanation, not an unrelated typo you fixed  somewhere else.</p>

<p>Every commit should leave the application in a working state.</p>

<h2>Good commit messages</h2>

<ul>
<li>First line is a subject and is 72 characters long</li>
<li>Describes what the change does</li>
<li>If you have refactored or performed an otherwise complex change, add an extended body below the subject (separated by an empty line).</li>
</ul>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre><code>Refactor homepage

This change makes sure all content is loaded before the images.
</code></pre>

<h2>WIP commits</h2>

<p>It&#39;s not always clear up front what the atomic parts of a change are. Also you might just want to commit everything and push it to the server at the end of your workday. That&#39;s where the WIP (=Work in Progress) commit comes in.</p>

<p>Some rules about WIP commits:</p>

<ul>
<li>They should never-ever appear in master, develop</li>
<li>They must be split into proper atomic commits before merging a release branch, feature branch or hotfix branch.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Pull requests</h1>

<p>All feature branches or hotfixes should be pull requests. A pull request makes it easy to run builds against the changes and review code. It also provides an easy way to merge a feature branch.</p>

<h2>WIP pull requests</h2>

<p>Sometimes you want a colleague to look at your code even though it&#39;s still work in progress. In that case you can prefix the subject of the pull request with <code>[WIP]</code> or <code>WIP:</code>. That signifies that the pull request is still work in progress and should not be merged.</p>

<p>Once you are done with the PR, you must remove the prefix from the subject. </p>
