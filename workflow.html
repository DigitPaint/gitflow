      <h1>Workflow</h1>

<p>... or how to get things done.</p>

<h2>New feature or bug</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a new feature branch from develop</li>
<li>Build the feature or fix the bug and create beautiful commits</li>
<li>Prepare for a pull request:

<ol>
<li>Clean up your branches history</li>
<li>Rebase your branch on develop</li>
<li>Push to remote</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Create pull request

<ol>
<li>Build passes?</li>
<li>Code has been reviewed?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Fix any issues that arise from build/review without creating fix commits</li>
<li>Force push to remote</li>
<li>Update pull request

<ol>
<li>Build passes?</li>
<li>Code has been reviewed?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Rebase on develop if needed</li>
<li>Merge non-fast-forward into develop</li>
<li>Delete feature branch</li>
</ol>

<h2>Large-scale feature, overhaul or change</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a new integration branch from develop</li>
<li>Create feature branches on the integration branch and apply the workflow as you would on develop except that you merge into the integration branch</li>
<li>Rebase the integration branch on develop</li>
<li>Merge non-fast-forward into develop</li>
<li>Delete integration branch</li>
</ol>

<h3>Keeping the integration branch in sync with develop</h3>

<p>As new features are being developed on develop you probably want to have those changes in the integration branch as well. </p>

<ol>
<li>Warn all people working with/on the integration branch that you&#39;re going to update it.</li>
<li>Rebase the integration branch on develop</li>
<li>Force push the integration branch</li>
<li>Tell your colleagues to <code>git checkout NAME_OF_INTEGRATION_BRANCH</code>, <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git reset --hard origin/NAME_OF_INTEGRATION_BRANCH</code> <strong>Warning</strong> They&#39;ll lose any work that has been directly commited on the integration branch and was not pushed before your rebase. Hence the warning beforehand.</li>
<li>Your colleagues can now rebase their feature branches and are all up to date.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Releasing</h2>

<ol>
<li>Create a new release branch from develop. By doing this you have frozen the features in that release branch.</li>
<li>Prepare for release (update changelog, etc.)</li>
<li>Deploy release branch to test/staging servers</li>
<li>Fix any issues that have been found during testing</li>
<li>Merge non-fast-forward into master</li>
<li>Delete release branch</li>
<li>Tag the release on master</li>
<li>Merge master back into develop</li>
<li>Deploy master to production</li>
</ol>

<h2>Emergencies</h2>

<p>Whenever problems arise in existing releases.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a hotfix branch from master</li>
<li>Build the fix</li>
<li>Create a pull request

<ol>
<li>Build passes?</li>
<li>Code has been reviewed?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Prepare for release (update changelog, etc.)</li>
<li>Merge non-fast-forward into master </li>
<li>Delete hotfix branch</li>
<li>Tag the release on master</li>
<li>Merge master back into develop</li>
<li>Deploy master to production</li>
</ol>
