      <h1>The branches</h1>

<ol>
<li>Master</li>
<li>Develop</li>
<li>Feature branches (feature-x, bug-x)</li>
<li>Release branches (release-x)</li>
<li>Hotfix branches (hotfix-x)</li>
<li>Integration branches (integration-X)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Master</h2>

<p>Master is your &quot;holy&quot; branch and should always be exactly what you have in production.</p>

<p>The rules about master:</p>

<ul>
<li>No force pushing</li>
<li>No direct commits</li>
<li>Accepts only merges from:

<ul>
<li>Develop</li>
<li>Release branches</li>
<li>Hotfix branches</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Merges are always non-fast-forward</li>
<li>Must be merged back into develop whenever something is merged into master</li>
</ul>

<h2>Develop</h2>

<p>Develop is where future versions with fixes and changes of your application reside. It should always be in a working and releasable state. </p>

<p>The rules about develop:</p>

<ul>
<li>No force pushing</li>
<li>Direct commits only for really small one-commit fixes</li>
<li>Accepts only merges from:

<ul>
<li>Feature branches</li>
<li>Integration branches</li>
<li>Master</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Merges are always non-fast-forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feature branches</h2>

<p>Feature branches are the most common type of branch you will create and use. Every (non-urgent)bugfix or new feature will be built in a feature branch.</p>

<p>The rules about feature branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Name should always start with &quot;feature-&quot; or &quot;bug-&quot;</li>
<li>A feature branch must have a clean history</li>
<li>A feature branch must be reviewed before it&#39;s merged</li>
<li>All tests and builds must pass before it&#39;s merged</li>
<li>Must be rebased on target branch (develop / integration) before it&#39;s merged</li>
<li>Only 1 or 2 people should be working on a feature</li>
<li>Branches off from:

<ul>
<li>Develop</li>
<li>Integration branch</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can only be merged into:

<ul>
<li>Develop</li>
<li>Integration branch</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Integration branches</h2>

<p>Integration branches are just a separate develop branch for big features. They are useful when you&#39;re developing a big new feature that consist of many smaller features. Integration branches should be handles as if they were develop.</p>

<p>The rules about integration branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be cautious about force pushing</li>
<li>Direct commits only for really small one-commit fixes</li>
<li>Must be rebased on develop before it&#39;s merged</li>
<li>Branches off from:

<ul>
<li>Develop</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Accepts only merges from:

<ul>
<li>Feature branches</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can only be merged into:

<ul>
<li>Develop</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Merges are always non-fast-forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>Release branches</h2>

<p>Release branches are created when a certain point of develop should be feature-frozen and be readied for release. In a release branch you&#39;ll typically update changelogs and do minor fixes. A release branch is also a typical candidate to release to a test-environment for your (internal)client to test.</p>

<p>The rules about release branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>They&#39;re optional but recommended</li>
<li>May not contain new features after branching off</li>
<li>Branches off from: 

<ul>
<li>Develop</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can only be merged into:

<ul>
<li>Master</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Merges are always non-fast-forward</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hotfix branches</h2>

<p>Hotfix branches are created when there is an urgent issue in production. </p>

<p>The rules about hotfix branches:</p>

<ul>
<li>Same rules as release branches</li>
<li>Must have a clean history before merging</li>
<li>Branches off from:

<ul>
<li>Master</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can only be merged into:

<ul>
<li>Master</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
