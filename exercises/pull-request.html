      <h1>Pull requests</h1>

<p>Up until now we have manually merged features. This is quite tedious as you have to check if things can be merged manually and it&#39;s not always instantly clear what you&#39;re merging.</p>

<p>In these excercises you&#39;ll learn how to create and use pull requests to the full potential.</p>

<h2>Before you begin</h2>

<ol>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/DigitPaint/gitflow-exercises">https://github.com/DigitPaint/gitflow-exercises</a></li>
<li>Clone the repository into a new directory (Do not re-use the working directory from another exercise).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Adding a feature</h2>

<p>In this exercise you&#39;ll (again) add a feature for &#39;Hello World&#39; in PHP.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a new feature branch from the <code>develop</code> branch</li>
<li>Add one or two hello world variants in PHP. For the sake of this exercise, add a typo somewhere.</li>
<li>Update the readme</li>
<li>Commit as you would</li>
<li>Push &amp; create a pull request</li>
<li>Review your own changes (or let someone else do that) on Github (and notice your typo)</li>
<li>Fix your typo</li>
<li>Merge your PR in Github</li>
<li>Make sure your feature branch will be deleted</li>
</ol>

<h2>Merging feature by pull-request</h2>

<p>In this exercise you&#39;ll create and merge an existing feature for &#39;Hello World&#39; in Bash.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
<li>Create a PR for the <code>feature-hello-bash</code> branch</li>
<li>Fix conflicts</li>
<li>Merge the PR</li>
<li>Remove the source branch</li>
</ol>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<ul>
<li>What strategy did you apply to get the <code>feature-hello-bash</code> in a mergeable state?</li>
<li>Why do you think having &quot;Fix typo&quot; commits may not be the best idea?</li>
</ul>
