# Working on features

In these excercises you'll learn how to create and merge features.

## Before you begin
1. Fork https://github.com/DigitPaint/gitflow-exercises
2. Clone the repository into a new directory (Do not re-use the working directory from another exercise).

## Adding a feature

In this exercise you'll add a feature branch for 'Hello World' in PHP.

### Steps

1. Create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch
2. Add one or two hello world variants in PHP
3. Update the readme
4. Commit as you would
5. Merge the feature branch in `develop`
6. Don't forget to remove the source branch

## Finish a feature

In this exercise you'll merge an existing feature for 'Hello World' in Bash.

### Steps

1. Merge the branch `feature-hello-bash`
2. Remove the source branch

## Discussion

- Why do the two feature branches merge differently? Do you think this matters?
- What are potential problems working like this?
