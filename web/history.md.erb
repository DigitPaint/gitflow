# History
There is nothing more frustrating than looking at a commit from 6 months ago  that just says "Fix bug" or "Refactor" when you were looking at the reason behind a change. A good and clean version history gives you the power to:

- Find where and why bugs were introduced
- Why certain changes happened
- What has been released when
- What feature has been built when
